- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @StrontyD
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in more things than I can know in one life time
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently dipping my toes into Python, C++ and also playing around in Linux (again)
- ğŸ“« How to reach me? splintered6 at hotmail is an option. Not expecting too much traffic there though :-)
